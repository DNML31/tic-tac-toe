# tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe game in Ruby

# TTT.rb
This version was created when I wasn't able to figure out a solution to some
issues in the original tic-tac-toe.rb program. This version is much simpler but
that also means it's not as fully created as the other one. 

It also seems to suffer from the same issue of not being able to detect a win
after an invalid selection is made.
